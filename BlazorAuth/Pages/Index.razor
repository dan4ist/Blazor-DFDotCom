		<h4>About</h4>
		<p>
			My name is Danny Forrest and I am a software engineer living in Santa Cruz, CA.  This site is meant to be
			both a display of some of my capabilities as well as a playground of sorts for my to further my programming skills.

		<h4>Site Architecture</h4>
		<p>
			This site is built using Blazor Server Side on .NET Core 3.0 (Preview 8).  It utilizes the built-in individual
			user account authentication model provided by Microsoft.  I have also incorporated Dapper for ORM in other areas
			because Entity Framework is too painful to build quick-evolving applications on entirely.
